        Welcome to Lenselle Photography! My name is Lee Ann Staley, and I am a passionate photographer and videographer based in Idaho. I specialize in capturing life's most precious moments through my lens, creating timeless memories for my clients. Read on to learn about my story.</p>
    
      <h4>Videography:</h4>  
        <p>Ever since I was a little girl, I remember getting my first FLIP camera in 2011 from my dear father. I brought it on a family Disney Cruise and was able to capture a lot of priceless memories there from the delicious gourmet foods to the moment in time that I was taller than my little brother, and some of the peak moments of fun with my family and new friends there. Through the years, I continued to vlog (video log) my adventures with friends and family, and watched us all change throughout the years. As I was watching back the video footage, I reminisced and relived some of those moments. It's a great reminder of how fast time goes by and of the moments that we share that we can never get back, but they are special because they only happen once. My memory is not the best, and I know that it will only get worse as I age, so I am glad I was able to record those times. Thanks to those old videos, my future kids and posterity can enjoy those moments too. </p>
    - <h4>Photography:</h4> 
            <img src="images/purplehair.jpg" alt="image for homepage">
        <p>I started taking an interest in photography when my dad let my sister and I borrow his DSLR Nikon camera. We had home photoshoots dressed like fairies, took pictures of each other in our backyard with our purple and pink-dyed hair, had a fashion photoshoot like in the magazines, took some photos during golden hour and sunset, and had so much fun learning and experimenting with photography. Flash forward to today and we still both enjoy taking photos and having photoshoots when we visit each other. </p>
    - <h4>Lenselle Photography: </h4>
        <p> I bought my first camera only a few years ago and have since been experimenting when I had the idea to expand and take photos for other people. I got so much joy out of looking back at the photos, videos, and memories that I recorded that I also wanted other people to enjoy those feelings. I advertised on a couple of Facebook groups that I was on for people around my age. It started with taking photos for peoples’ LinkedIn profile pictures and dating app profiles. Then it escalated to family portraits and even more fun and creative photoshoots for couples. The journey has been really fulfilling, especially when I see my clients burst with happiness and grow in self-confidence as they can see the beauty that has lied within them that was only recently revealed through my camera’s lenses. With that, Lenselle Photography was born. </p>
    - <h4>My Mission: </h4>
        <p></p>Since I was able to look back on my memories through countless photographs and video clips. I remember the precious memories and it feels like I am reliving those special moments and the joys that it brought me with my loved ones. These moments in life are what make a life worth living and I want to keep them safe and close to me as I treasure them throughout my life. This life goes by so fast and I know that kids grow up and you see yourself getting older and older.
